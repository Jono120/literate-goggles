# Literate Goggles Project
This is a Computer Vision tool that is built based off of the Tensorflow technology.
This is one part of an assignment for my Masters in AI.

Literate Goggles is a beginning component of a mobile application that will use the phones/tablets camera to detect items and classify them based on prior learnings.
